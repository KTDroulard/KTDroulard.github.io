This vulnerability came to light in April 2017, when a group called The Shadow Brokers leaked a toolset belonging to the NSA-linked group Equation Group. While the leak unveiled a stock pile of zero-day exploits, it was EternalBlue that truly became infamous. </p> <p>Attacks like WannaCry (May 2017) and NotPetya (June 2017) were direct fallout from this leak. Millions of businesses, hospitals, and governments were affected. The aftermath sparked global concern about the risks of stockpiling zero day vulnerabilities.</p> <p>If your curious about the bigger picture behind zero-day exploits and cyber arms dealing, check out This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends by Nicole Perlroth.  Her writing reads like a Bond novel, weaving real-world cyber espionage into a gripping, global narrative.</p> <p>In the remainder of this write-up, we\u2019ll examine the EternalBlue exploit from an attacker\u2019s perspective by completing the \u2018Blue\u2019 room on TryHackMe.</p>"},{"location":"writeups/CTFs/AStudyInBlue/#initial-discovery","title":"Initial Discovery:","text":"<p>After booting up the Blue machine, the first step is to perform a port scan to identify potential vulnerabilities.
